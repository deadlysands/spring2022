        <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace">This project’s goal was to encapsulate the concept of the mind, body and the spirit into a collage of pictures I feel that represents myself. For my collages, I collected pictures I felt represented certain parts of me, some more abstract than others in terms of symbolism. I really wanted the first two (mind and body)  to feel more ‘collage-like’ than the last one (spirit). This is because I feel like my ‘spirit’ is less cluttered and chaotic than my ‘mind’ and ‘body’. I mostly wanted spirit collage to be a cohesive picture and not feel like a collage. As for the mind and body collages, I wanted these to feel busy, colorful, and chaotic. I made this decision because those are good descriptors for my mind and body as well, and I wanted the meaning of the colleges to go beyond just the individual pictures used. Overall, I feel like these pieces are successful in developing my essence into a multi-media collage. </p>
